    text: `<b>Ribbit</b> is an iOS app I developed as part of my senior thesis to help second-language learners acquire Mandarin tones through interactive pitch visualization and gamified feedback. The app is built in Swift and integrates advanced audio processing techniques, leveraging pitch contours and formant analysis to provide real-time pronunciation feedback. Users can see a visual representation of their pitch alongside an idealized native speaker model, allowing them to adjust and refine their pronunciation dynamically.`,

    details: `<b>Technical Highlights:</b><br />
    <b>1. Custom Voice Analysis API:</b> Developed a cloud-based API that processes and returns pitch data, analyzing users' speech in real-time.<br />
    <b>2. Adaptive Pitch Calibration:</b> Detects and calibrates each user‚Äôs vocal range, dynamically adjusting the app‚Äôs scoring algorithm to enhance accuracy. This personalized adjustment allows the app to provide more reliable tone recognition, automatically scoring and delivering real-time feedback based on the user‚Äôs unique pitch profile.<br />
    <b>3. Gamified Learning:</b> Integrated themes, customizable sprites, and a dynamic reward system to enhance engagement and retention.<br />
    <b>4. Scalable Modular Design:</b> Ribbit teaches Chinese progressively, starting from fundamental phonetics and advancing through vocabulary-rich modules that are useful in real life scenarios. <br /><br />
    
    <b>Current Features & Learning Modules:</b><br />
    At this stage, Ribbit includes 5 interactive modules, each set in a unique environment:<br />
    1. üå± <b>Foundation Islands:</b> Master the basics of Pinyin and Mandarin tones.<br />
    2. ‚úàÔ∏è <b>Airport:</b> Learn travel-related phrases and tone combinations.<br />
    3. ‚òï <b>Caf√©:</b> Practice ordering food.<br />
    4. üèñÔ∏è <b>Beach:</b> Reinforce pronunciation with conversational scenarios.<br />
    5. ‚õ∫ <b>Camping:</b> Introduction to advanced tone concepts.<br /><br />
    
    <b>Research & Linguistic Study:</b><br />
    Beyond its technical implementation, Ribbit was also the subject of a linguistic study examining the effectiveness of visual feedback in Mandarin tone acquisition. I conducted an experiment with three groups:<br />
    1Ô∏è. A control group with no visual feedback, only schematics are provided.<br />
    2Ô∏è. A group with static visual feedback.<br />
    3Ô∏è. A group using Ribbit‚Äôs interactive pitch visualization, with animated feedback.<br /><br />
    
    Findings from the study will be presented at <b>Carnegie Mellon's Meeting of the Minds</b> and at the <b>National Conference on Undergraduate Research</b>, which will be held in April, 2025. <br /><br />
    
    <b>Future Plans:</b> Ribbit is designed to be scalable, with potential expansions including more themes, additional tone challenges, celebrity audio and AI-driven feedback for even greater accuracy.`,
